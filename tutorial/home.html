          <p>
            WebRTC, short for Web Real-Time Communication, is an influential
            open-source project that empowers web browsers and mobile
            applications to engage in seamless real-time communication. As an
            advanced technology, it has undergone significant evolution and
            refinement to fulfill the growing demand for a standardized,
            efficient, and secure means of real-time interaction over the vast
            realm of the internet. This revolutionary project has revolutionized
            the way we communicate and collaborate online. By leveraging a
            combination of robust APIs and protocols, WebRTC facilitates the
            effortless exchange of audio, video, and data between users,
            transcending geographical barriers and enabling rich, immersive
            experiences. Its versatility has made it an indispensable tool for a
            broad range of applications, including video conferencing, live
            streaming, online gaming, and much more. WebRTC's core strengths lie
            in its ability to establish peer-to-peer connections, eliminating
            the need for intermediaries and minimizing latency. This
            decentralized architecture not only ensures faster and more
            efficient communication but also enhances security and privacy. With
            built-in encryption mechanisms, WebRTC guarantees end-to-end
            protection of sensitive data, making it a reliable choice for
            confidential conversations and data transfer.

          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">History</h1>
          <p>
            Origins (2010-2011):
            Since its initial release by Google in 2011, WebRTC has become widely used on a number of platforms and browsers. The necessity for an open-source, standardized method of real-time Internet communication propelled its development. WebRTC has been a flexible tool for data sharing, voice calls, and video conferences since it was first developed and now includes a wide range of capabilities and functionalities. 

            Formation of W3C and IETF Working Groups (2011-2013): 
            To standardize WebRTC, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed working groups. The W3C Web Real-Time Communications Working Group focused on API and JavaScript issues, while the IETF Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWEB) Working Group worked on protocols and data formats.

            Standardization (2014): 
            WebRTC 1.0 was officially standardized by the W3C and IETF in 2014. The specifications cover APIs for real-time communication, including audio and video calling and data sharing between browsers.

            Relevant Standards:
            W3C WebRTC API: The W3C standardizes the JavaScript API for WebRTC, defining how developers interact with the technology in web applications.

            IETF RTCWEB Protocols: The IETF standardizes the underlying protocols, such as the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for media transport and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) for session negotiation.

            Security Standards: WebRTC incorporates security measures, and Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is used for encrypting audio and video streams. Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is employed for key exchange.
